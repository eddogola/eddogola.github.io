        Hey this is <strong>Ogola Eddy</strong>. I think of myself as an artist and scientist. 
        I am currently a sophomore at <a href="web.mit.edu">MIT</a> pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Engineering
        (<a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-3-computer-science-and-engineering/">6-3</a>)
        and Mathematics (<a href="https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18/general.html">18</a>), and concentrating in 
        writing (<a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/education/writing/undergraduate/">21W</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        I am interested in the intersection of computer systems and artificial intelligence. I am still exploring both, very overlapping,
        fields and I'm working towards finding a research area I am very curious about. 

        Aside from those technical interests, I spend my time writing poetry, reading, and taking photographs.
