    <p>
        I'm a big fan of literature, particularly fiction, but I am trying to expand the domain of books I read.
        Now I want to read political and economic history, African literature, and more classic fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
        My best books of all time are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Collector-Back-Bay-Books/dp/0316290238">The Collector by John Fowles</a>
         and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Misery-Novel-Stephen-King/dp/1501156748">Misery by Stephen King</a>, both
        books influencing my life so far
    </p>
