    <h3>How to</h3>
    <p>
        surrender,
        yes,

        let the redness that congests,
        the sponge of your lungs grow roots;
        nourish that growth with fresh tears,
        if you have to. and let the anger

        you've birthed, find a helplessness
        the ancient owners of my names
        discovered, when men in white suits
        for skin, skinned, plundered, and poked
        bleeding holes on them to surrender
        the earth that raised them

        all that red.
        all the rage.

        yes,
        surrender

    <h3>Washed Fruit</h3>
    <p>
        the blue-black night chokes
        the sun
        and I ache
        for the softness
        I do not possess.

        Last year lent me a new secret.
        The pleasure of drinking water,
        as if you're breathing slow,
        how it is sustenance, 
        but mostly escape,
        from the violence of self.

        the quick, cold grip it holds
        on the throat,
        the liquid rush,
        release,
        respite?

        the malevolence in my heart,
        sings a loud screech, and

        the days collect in the lonely
        corner of the calendar,
        and I beg the next days, to

        lead me to softness,
        lead me to radiant fields of softness,
        lay me down on a bed in the fields of softness,

        to wash up the dusty
        shell of my human heart,
        like fruit

    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>
        Today I talked to God,
        muffled whispers, colored by sniffles,
        in the lonely company of my selves,
        like a mad,
        man, like

        the times mother got mad,
        and I had to hide,
        in the folds of that angry,
        house

        Don't you just love,
        how silence sharpens the tender blade,
        of love?
        How deep the knife of love cuts,
        in the ocean quiet?
        How much bleeding?

        America, angry house,
        I am a man mad, angry house.
        Can you love me, angry house?
        without bleeding, angry house?

        Can you let,
        black,
        life bloom,
        green?

        My God,
        I pray for stillness.

    <h3>End with a metaphor that gasps for air or water</h3>
    <p>
        not a single care,
        did my soul spare,
        for whatever worries,
        that woman buried.

        her private ills,
        and public wails,

        the prancing pains she had to smother,
        while us she wanted to mother.

        her tears eternally internal, 
        internally eternal,

        I could not see,
        my heart shut like eyes.

    <h3>Brother</h3>
    <p>
        "Hold you birds your silver throats, His golden voice I'm seeking"

        See,
        your voice
        your smooth rasping voice
        lulls me to sleep

        Oh,
            to fall asleep
                in the cozy little caves
                in the valleys
                in the landscape
                of your voice

            to cover the glass, of my
                darkened
                distressed
                debilitated
                eyes
                with the drapes of your voice

            to cover the skin, of my
                caving
                crying
                chilling
                body
                with the quilt of your voice
    </p>

        Her love
            grabs me by the reins.
            grasps my heart
            clutching. and letting go.
            clasping. and letting go.
                pumping life.
                teaching me to breathe.

        Her name
            music. lofi. song.
            pouring rain. cracking fire.
            hands. holding hands.
            warmth.

        Her
            more than
            fibers. sinews.
            skin. flesh.
            bone.

        Her
            elegance. freedom. and
            everything I know.

        Her

    <h3>Wed, 6 Jan</h3>
    <p>
        There was a time,
        I thought that there was more music in the high-pitched giggle of your laugh,
        than the chanting of chanticleer at dawn.

        I thought,
        While stargazing at your honey eyes,
        that they had more color,
        than the sun's splash of gold in a summer morn

        Your head on my shoulder, lips zipped in sleep drawing in your dimples,
        I thought,
        I was more peaceful than I would have been,
        lying in the fold of nature staring through the green web of leaves and branches, into the bluest of bluest skies

        I fancied,
        that kissing you under the sun's pale imposter,
        would set my heart on a gracious ballet,
        than serenading myself in a cold bath

        I was convinced,
        that your love made me more drunk,
        than I would ever have been,
        on life

        But now,
        now,
        I know better
    </p>

    <h3>An Ode To Your Feet</h3>
    <p>
        naked,
        dangling in the blue wavy ocean water,
        I see them, as small as planes of paper,
        your feet,
        pure, unadulterated,
        slapping the water with raw, unbridled passion,
        and power,

        I see them,
        waltzing confusedly,
        in the romantic semi-darkness of prom night,
        when they knew, you knew not, how to dance.

        even now,
        in the small hours of the night,
        I see them,
        flailing unconsciously,
        beneath  sheets of silk,

        your feet,
        meeting mine,
        touch,
        warmth.

        Bless your feet,
        that brought you to me.
