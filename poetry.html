    <h3>Traveling light</h3>
    <i>
        For bearing Keats' empty vessel... I forgive you<br>
        ~ Dilruba Ahmed
    </i>
    <p>
        curled like arthritic hands,<br>
        gray-white shrimp,<br>
        innocent in her foetal arc,<br>
        <br>
        rises in my deft black hands,<br>
        like a doctor's syringe held against the light,<br>
        skeleton scales and fragile freeze <br>
        drop under the critical command <br>
        of my culinary sleight-of-hand. <br>
        <br>
        entrapped in a vortex of lethargy, <br>
        carnal cruetly and limitless longing <br>
        my soul croons for freedom from humdrum notes. <br>
        priesthood and beasthood rage wild in her; <br>
        <br>
        I oscillate between pain and pleasure, <br>
        like a spirited breeze in the summer sun. <br>
        <br>
        my tender soul sings to shed, <br>
        her encumberances like Kafka's beetle, <br>
        <br>
        like the great white shrimp, <br>
        unclothed, deveined, <br>
        but armored with another chance to live, <br>
        <br>
        light, and right. <br>

    <h3>How to</h3>
    <p>
        surrender, <br>
        yes, <br>
        <br>
        let the redness that congests, <br>
        the sponge of your lungs grow roots; <br>
        nourish that growth with fresh tears, <br>
        if you have to. and let the anger <br>

        you've birthed, find a helplessness <br>
        the ancient owners of my names <br>
        discovered, when men in white suits <br>
        for skin, skinned, plundered, and poked <br>
        bleeding holes on them to surrender <br>
        the earth that raised them <br>
        <br>
        all that red. <br>
        all the rage. <br>
        <br>
        yes, <br>
        surrender <br>
        <br>

    <h3>Washed Fruit</h3>
    <p>
        the blue-black night chokes <br>
        the sun <br>
        and I ache <br>
        for the softness <br>
        I do not possess. <br>
        <br>
        Last year lent me a new secret. <br>
        The pleasure of drinking water, <br>
        as if you're breathing slow, <br>
        how it is sustenance, <br>
        but mostly escape, <br>
        from the violence of self. <br>
        <br>
        the quick, cold grip it holds <br>
        on the throat, <br>
        the liquid rush, <br>
        release, <br>
        respite? <br>
        <br>
        the malevolence in my heart, <br>
        sings a loud screech, and <br>
        <br>
        the days collect in the lonely <br>
        corner of the calendar, <br>
        and I beg the next days, to <br>
        <br>
        lead me to softness, <br>
        lead me to radiant fields of softness, <br>
        lay me down on a bed in the fields of softness, <br>
        <br>
        to wash up the dusty <br>
        shell of my human heart, <br>
        like fruit <br>
        <br>

    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>
        Today I talked to God, <br>
        muffled whispers, colored by sniffles, <br>
        in the lonely company of my selves, <br>
        like a mad, <br>
        man, like <br>
        <br>
        the times mother got mad, <br>
        and I had to hide, <br>
        in the folds of that angry, <br>
        house <br>
        <br>
        Don't you just love, <br>
        how silence sharpens the tender blade, <br>
        of love? <br>
        How deep the knife of love cuts, <br>
        in the ocean quiet? <br>
        How much bleeding? <br>
        <br>
        America, angry house, <br>
        I am a man mad, angry house. <br>
        Can you love me, angry house? <br>
        without bleeding, angry house? <br>
        <br>
        Can you let, <br>
        black, <br>
        life bloom, <br>
        green? <br>
        <br>
        My God, <br>
        I pray for stillness. <br>

    <h3>End with a metaphor that gasps for air or water</h3>
    <p>
        not a single care, <br>
        did my soul spare, <br>
        for whatever worries, <br>
        that woman buried. <br>
        <br>
        her private ills, <br>
        and public wails, <br>
        <br>
        the prancing pains she had to smother, <br>
        while us she wanted to mother. <br>
        <br>
        her tears eternally internal, <br>
        internally eternal, <br>
        <br>
        I could not see, <br>
        my heart shut like eyes. <br>

    <h3>Wed, 6 Jan</h3>
    <p>
        There was a time, <br>
        I thought that there was more music in the high-pitched giggle of your laugh, <br>
        than the chanting of chanticleer at dawn. <br>
        <br>
        I thought, <br>
        While stargazing at your honey eyes, <br>
        that they had more color, <br>
        than the sun's splash of gold in a summer morn <br>
        <br>
        Your head on my shoulder, lips zipped in sleep drawing in your dimples, <br>
        I thought, <br>
        I was more peaceful than I would have been, <br>
        lying in the fold of nature staring through the green web of leaves and branches, into the bluest of bluest skies <br>
        <br>
        I fancied, <br>
        that kissing you under the sun's pale imposter, <br>
        would set my heart on a gracious ballet, <br>
        than serenading myself in a cold bath <br>
        <br>
        I was convinced, <br>
        that your love made me more drunk, <br>
        than I would ever have been, <br>
        on life <br>
        <br>
        But now, <br>
        now, <br>
        I know better <br>

    <h3>An Ode To Your Feet</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-right: 80%;">
        naked, <br>
        dangling in the blue wavy ocean water, <br>
        I see them, as small as planes of paper, <br>
        your feet, <br>
        pure, unadulterated, <br>
        slapping the water with raw, unbridled passion, <br>
        and power, <br>
        <br>
        I see them, <br>
        waltzing confusedly, <br>
        in the romantic semi-darkness of prom night, <br>
        when they knew, you knew not, how to dance. <br>
        <br>
        even now, <br>
        in the small hours of the night, <br>
        I see them, <br>
        flailing unconsciously, <br>
        beneath  sheets of silk, <br>
        <br>
        your feet, <br>
        meeting mine, <br>
        touch, <br>
        warmth. <br>
        <br>
        Bless your feet, <br>
        that brought you to me. <br>
