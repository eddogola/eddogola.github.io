    <h3>Turning 22</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "May 13, 1822. In twelve days I shall be niteneen years old; which I count a miserable thing. Has any other educated person lived
        so many years and lost so many days?...
        <br>
        Look next from the history of my intellect to the history of my heart. A blank, my lord. I have not the kind affectations of a
        pigeon. Ungenerous & selfish, cautious & cold, I yet wish to be romantic. Have not sufficient feeling to speak a naturally hearty
        welcome to a friend or stranger and yet send abroad wishes & fancies of a friendship with a man I never knew. There is not in the whole wide
        Universe of God(my relations to Himself I do not understand) one being to whom I am attached with warm & entire devotion, -- not a
        being to whom I have joined fate for weal or wo, not one whose interests I have nearly & dearly at heart; -- and this I say at the most 
        susceptible age of man." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In a few hours, I will be turning 22. Since graduating high school(in November 2019), and especially since getting into
        MIT(December 19th 2021), life has been a blur. The past two and a half years have been characterized by the most drastic
        external changes, including moving to a new country, starting college, and navigating everything that comes with being a
        young adult, from relationships to dreams.
        <br>
        I came to the US, excited to meet people who I will actually feel natural around, since most of my prior relationships
        (friends and family alike) didn't reach the glorified image I had of lifelong camaraderie. I had a faint idea of what
        I wanted to study and do with my life professionally, otherwise.
        <br>
        Now, two years since, the most important thing I've learnt at MIT is the nobility of work, and intimations of the shape
        of work I'd like to do over the course of my lifetime. Navigating late teens has also taught me more than I was cocky enough
        to think I know about human relationships; the core of my new, but very early, philosophy on this matter is that I ought to
        strive to be honest in interactions with other human beings and that I should be dedicate my faculties to listen and observe,
        as if I were listening to music that works on me, or observing a thing of beauty, like the south-bay-area sun.
        <br>
        Granted, I've learned more than that, but all this is to say that I've lived unconsciously for too long. In a few hours begins
        a decade that I'd want to live(empasis on this, not survive) with ultimate deliberation, singleness of purpose, genuineness of heart,
        and intensity of focus. I want to bring myself to focus on two things: 1. love and 2. work. The past unconscious years have been training for
        what's to come. I understand that these are too large of bullseyes to aim my dart with intent, but this is what I know now; I'll be keen to develop my foci over time, very seriously.
        <br>
        Let me expand on what I mean by both:
        <ol>
            <li>Love: be a person worth calling a friend, a shoulder to lean on. The definition of love that I grew to confer with the most is,
                <i>love is <b>knowing</b> someone and letting them <b>know</b> you.</i>; get to know people, be genuinely curious about their lives --
                where they come from, where they seek to go, moments that define their lives... Truly listen, my heart, and pray for a pureness in spirit
                that I may be such a person in perpetuity; Strive for this.</li>
            <li>Work: follow the hermetic philosophy of creation. Create more than you consume. Become an expert. Become reliable. Say yes to only
                the few things that I will do with excellence, and for such things, think creatively and humanely such that you provide value so idiosyncratic
                in nature, that only you can do. Seek out a rhythmic habit for your work, and only prioritize putting forward work that you deem
                good/decent/great. <br>
                More specifically, I am a knowledge worker making my main craft to be that of the mind. My main technical interests lie in 
                computer systems and artificial intelligence. A level beneath are my interests in mathematics and computational biology.
                Artistically, I am interested in good writing, and are curious to make essays and poetry. My artistic hobbies
                are photography and DJing. <br>
                I need to develop a better idea of what I'd want to do in each of these spaces, but for now I know that technically I want to truly
                understand things, and make (beautiful) things that other people use. A n√§ive way to measure this in technology is keeping count of
                the number of people who use what you made. If a lot of people are standing on your shoulders, then you have built something technically
                beautiful. As far as I understand, then technical (computer science) work, can fall in one of the following three buckets: 
                1) startup, most successful is most users are happy; hallmark of success is being a unicorn 2) big(used by a lot of people) open source project
                3) seminal research paper. Given my absence in knowledge of a better measure, I shall go with this for my work in systems, AI, mathematics and computational
                biology. Of course, good work takes a lot of time and it'll take a while since I am able to generate work that falls into one of these buckets,
                but it's good to know that that's what I am working towards. Artistically, I want to, similarly, make beautiful things, but those that stand the test of time. 
                My measure here is, very vain; with writing it's, first, meeting my satisfaction level(which I'd say I believe in), and, second, 
                submitting for publication in different avenues. 
                I'd be successful if I write, more and more, essays and poems that I like, and become accepted for publication(Rilke warns against this).
                <br>
                Given my life circumstances and aspirations, my priority will rest on technical work, while I hope to maintain a habit of writing.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Both of these come together, quoting Gibran again,
        <blockquote>
            <i>"Work is love made visible"</i>
        </blockquote>

        <br>

        Given the above breadown, my local focus will be to 1) be genuine and curious among my fellow men 2) code and study 3) write.

        <br>
        <br>
        That said, the list below enumerates what I hope to achieve in my 22nd year. God give me strength:
        <ol>
            habits:
            <li>write, nontrivial + beautiful(tested, clean, commented), code everyday (bright green github calendar)</li>
            <li>write a poem every week[end] and an essay once a month (New York Times publishable)</li>
            <li>journal every day(aspiring for a sophistication like Emerson's)</li>
            <li>read daily</li>
            <li>learn how to be good with money</li>
            <li>work out every week MWF, run SS</li>
            <li>eat(get to 75kg) and sleep well</li>
            technical:
            <li>keep a technical blog</li>
            <li>write an OS</li>
            <li>write a compiler</li>
            <li>write a minimal neural network library, like PyTorch</li>
            <li>write a weekend project every week, in one of the following languages to master: C/C++, CUDA, Rust, Go, Python</li>
            <li>master (at least a 1st-year-AI-PhD-level) AI theory/math(as we know it): convex optimization, information theory,
                mathematical statistics, probability, bayesian machine learning probability, and fundamental mathematical tools
                of main AI fields(NLP, CV, RL, Graph DL, biology machine learning)
            </li>
            <li>begin contributing to one of the following open source projects: JAX, flax, mojo, pytorch, tvm</li>
            <li>read and implement the most important papers in distributed systems</li>
            <li>get to the frontier of computer vision(random field of choice, I hope I like it): read and implement papers till most recent ones</li>
            <li>solve 3,000 leetcode problems</li>
            <li>brainstorm and build 10 production-ready AI applications in NLP, CV, RL, Graph DL and/or bioML</li>
            artistic:
            <li>pick and send my best poems, essays for submission each month</li>
            <li>pick and send my best pictures for submission to photovogue, perhaps other places</li>
            <li>DJ a boilerrom at PKT(lol)</li>
            others:
            <li>graduate</li>
            <li>get into MEng</li>
            <li>get an FB return offer</li>
            <li>get a FT job at Deepmind, DE Shaw Research, FAIR</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        The technical part is definitely going to be challenging, but I hope it will all be fun. To do this well, I need to establish an unshakeable
        working habit, and be able to measure it. The plan for now is a few hours of deep work a day towards these brain-heavy ends. In some cases, 
        I'll measure my productivity with lines of and complexity of code written, in others, the number of problems solved, and generally, number of
        hours spent.
        <br>
        <br>
        Generally, I want to tend to my inner garden, "contemplate & nourish my independence", and cultivate "a firmness of purpose".
        <br>
        <br>
        Let's turn 22!

        discipline myself with diligent care I shall suffer severely from the remorse & the sense of inferiority hereafter.
        All around me are industrious & will be great, I am indolent & shall be insignificant. Avert it heaven! avert it virtue!
